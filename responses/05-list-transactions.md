Clients use their accounts by performing transactions. Each transaction has:
* Source Account ID 
* Target Account ID
* Amount
* Date and time

Create a structure that would provide an easy way to store transactions.

We should also provide an easy way for clients to view the transactions in an account. You can use a dropdown list to let users select the period for which they want to list transactions.
